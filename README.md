A simple PowerShell script to automatically download all the mods you subscribed to on mod.io.

You will need to have let Sandstorm do an initial download of all mods before using this script.
The script cannot update the state.json file used by the game for giving mod information in the game
and this is why you have to let the game perform the initial downloads.

## Usage

1. Download the zip file and extract it anywhere.
2. Right-click the `Download_Sandstorm_Mods.ps1` file and select "Run with PowerShell".
3. Where to store
4. If you want to see more information of each mod you are subscribed enter Y for yes to enable Verbose mode.
5. You will be asked for a mod.io Token if you have alread entered one just pre ENTER to continue using it.  If not...

Use this method to authorize tools or dedicated servers.
1. Go to Mod.io and Log In to your account.
2. Click on the Button bottom right with a Letter in it to open your Navigation Menu.
3. Select API Access from the navigation menu.
4. Scroll to the OAuth Access section.
5. Where it says "Token Name*" enter Sandstorm and click on the + button.
6. You will see TOKEN CREATED! Click on the two pieces of paper (Copy to Clipboard) button on the left side of the
   string of number and letters.  This will copy the token.
7. When asked for the the Token 'OAuth token (Press ENTER to use CURRENT) []' paste what you have copied end press enter.

Your token will be saved for future use.  If you ever delete the token.cfg file you will need to repeate the above process.
You cannot retrieve the token at a later date.  You will need to delete the old token fromyour API Access page on
mod.io and then recreate it again for a new token.

If you have done the setup once then it'll just read the settings from the configuration file it generated and everything 
should happen automatically. If you want to redo the setup, delete or rename `config.json` and it should show the prompts again.

A window should open showing where your mod.io mod directory is located and asking if you would like to download
and extract the files there overwriting the existing files.  If you just want to test to make sure it is downloading the right
files just enter N(o) and a GUI will open letting you select a location.

Re-running the script at a later date, will check your subscriptions for updates and only download mods from new 
subscriptions or mods which have been updated.

If you receive a Warning List of files this just indicates 7-Zip found some unexpected things and the archive should have
extracted without issue.

If you receive an Error List of files you should scroll back up through Powershell to find those files to get more
detailed information about the error.  You can also see if the files were extracted or not.

Common 7-Zip Unzipping Errors

Data Error / CRC Error: Meaning: The data inside the Zip archive is corrupted, meaning the compressed data does not match the 
file's original Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value.

Can not open file as archive :Meaning: 7-Zip fails to recognize the file structure or format. This happens if the file download is 
incomplete, if the file extension is incorrect (e.g., trying to open a .gz file that is actually an XML document), or if the file 
was password-protected by a format 7-Zip doesn't fully support.

Headers Error: The header section of the archive—which contains critical metadata and structural information—is damaged.

Can not open output file / Access is denied: 7-Zip cannot create or write the destination file on your computer because of a 
Lack of administrator privileges on the destination folder.

Not enough space on disk: The destination drive doesn't have enough free storage to hold the unzipped files.

The most common errors will be CRC_Error or Lack of Drive Space.  I have found a couple of mod files that give CRC_Errors
and it looks like they were compressed and a bad CRC was created by whatever program was used to create the zip.

Change Log
==========

0.1 (2026-06-12) Initial Release

    1. Token variable moved to a token.cfg file so you will not need to get a new token if you delete the 
       config.json and haven't saved the old token id.
    2. Added getting the mod directory from the %localappdata%\mod.io\globalsettings.json
    3. Added a GUI selector for location if you want the mod files unpacked to a different 
       location for testing.
    4. A directory will now be created in the mod.io/mods directory using the mod_id to download and unpack
       the mod files.
    5. Removed Android platform support and only support Windows.
    6. config.json now contains the mod.io mod_id number and last update time for each mod for faster lookup
       of the latest update.
    7. Mod.io json files have changed since the BoneLabModDownloader was created and it has been updated to 
       work with the current system.
    8. Dropped the internal Powershell Extractor for Zip files as it was limited and would fail if the file 
       was larger than 4GB or if there were file crc errors that didn't corrupt the archive.
    9. Added error reporting and a lot more information as mod files being downloaded and extracted.
    10. If the numeric directory a mod is stored (ex: directory 123456 located in mod.io/254/mods/) has been 
        deleted it will trigger an automatic download and update when script has been executed.
    11. Completely rebuilding the state.json file using the subscribed mod information from mod.io.
    12. Added Paging support for subscriptions that contain more than 100 mod files.
